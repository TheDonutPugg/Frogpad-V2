This version of the project was a much more challenging one. Instead of controlling it with an arduino micro, it was controlled by an ESP32C3 XIAO using the arduino IDE and the BLE keyboard library. Some changes include a much much smaller case(about half the size), changes to the case to include a place for the USB-C port to poke out, and a spot for the on/off switch. it's all powered by an 840mAh LiPo battery contained inside the case. The top and bottom pieces are made to be held together with number 6 wood screws.
